# SlicerBoneMorphing
Extension for 3D Slicer for bone mesh morphing.

At the moment, this module specializes on the *humerus* bone, but the use case is not limited to it. 

## Special thanks üôè 
Special thanks goes to my wonderful colleagues [Eva C. Herbst](https://github.com/evaherbst) and [Arthur Porto](https://github.com/agporto) for creating the initial idea and their huge help during the development of this module! 
I would also like to thank [O. Hirose](https://github.com/ohirose) for the research on BCPD/GBCPD and it's implementation (can be found [here](https://github.com/ohirose/bcpd))

## Installation
**Supported platforms:**
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)
- MacOS (both x86_64 and ARM; Slicer runs through Rosetta on ARM-based Macs)

Steps:
- Download the latest ZIP package from [Releases](https://github.com/HarryHeres/SlicerBoneMorphing/releases)
- Extract the ZIP contents to your desired folder
- Open up 3D Slicer, go to Edit -> Application Settings
- In the modules section, add the extracted contents' path to "Additional Module Paths" 
- Restart 3D Slicer

## Usage
